Problem Statement & Goals

Problem: Travelers spend hours comparing blogs, hotels, and attractions. Existing tools either feel generic or require too many manual steps.

Goal: Build a conversational agent that:

Gathers a user’s constraints (destination(s), dates, budget, interests, mobility, companions).

Generates a day‑by‑day itinerary with travel times and opening hours.

Recommends hotels (ranked) and points of interest with justifications.

Exports/share plans and keeps trip memory across sessions.

Success Criteria (MVP):

The bot can plan a 3‑day itinerary for a single city with hotel suggestions within a user’s budget.

Save and re‑load trips from Supabase.




70% of pilot users rate itineraries ≥4/5 for usefulness.

Stretch:

Multi‑city routing with transit times.

Personalization from previous trips.

Live signals (weather, events, price ranges) via pluggable providers.
